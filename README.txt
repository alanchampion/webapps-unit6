Responsive Design Features:
	We set the viewport to be to the devices scale in the head. This makes the content scale better on mobile devices. 
	For most items, we used percentages for placements rather than pixels. This makes the content scale as expected on different sized screens. 
	Images scale depending on screen size using the percentages again. 
	We tried to use bootstrap elements when available rather than try to implement them on our own. Bootstrap elements are either automatically responsive or are easier to make responsive.
